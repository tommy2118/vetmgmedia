# VetMG Media LLC

## Business Model

VetMG Media serves contractors who need websites and online credibility to qualify for financing programs like [GreenSky](https://www.greensky.com/who-we-serve/). Many financing partners require contractors to have:
- A professional website
- Online reviews and ratings
- Digital presence that demonstrates legitimacy

We solve the qualification barrier without competing with their existing lead generation sources.

## The Core Differentiator

**We market websites like contractor trucks.**

You don't need to buy the fully loaded model upfront. Start with the base model that gets you qualified, then add features as your business grows and you can afford upgrades.

### Analogies That Resonate

**The Truck Analogy:**
- Start with the base model work truck that gets the job done
- Add the toolbox when you need it
- Upgrade to the crew cab when you hire more people
- Add the lift kit and custom paint when business is booming
- Same truck, built over time as your needs and budget allow

**The Back Piece Tattoo Analogy:**
- Outline first session
- Shading in the next
- Color work after that
- Touch-ups and additions over time
- Built over months/years for multiple reasons (including budget)
- Result is better because each session was focused and intentional

## Value Proposition

**We don't sell websites. We sell qualification and credibility on a payment plan that matches contractor cash flow.**

Most contractors can handle:
- $1,500 to get started and get qualified
- $200-300 every few months to add features
- Building their online presence like they built their business: one job at a time

## Technical Approach

- Static site generation for base packages (fast, secure, cheap to host)
- GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting
- Simple, semantic HTML/CSS
- Mobile-first responsive design (contractors work in the field)
- Easy to maintain and upgrade
- No complex CMSs for base packages
- Progressive enhancement as they upgrade

## Sales Messaging

**Wrong:** "We build websites for contractors."
**Right:** "We get you qualified for GreenSky financing without the $8K upfront cost."

**Wrong:** "Our SEO will generate leads."
**Right:** "You already get referrals. We make sure you look legitimate online when those customers Google you."

**Wrong:** "You need a 10-page website with all features."
**Right:** "Start with what you need to qualify. Add the toolbox later when you need it."

## Positioning Against Competition

- **vs. DIY (Wix, Squarespace):** They make you qualified faster and look more professional. We know what financing partners want to see.
- **vs. Big Agencies ($5K-15K):** Same end result, but you pay over time and get working immediately. No waiting to save up $8K.
- **vs. Cheap Freelancers:** We're vets serving trades. We understand the business model. We're here when you need upgrades.

## Veteran Connection

VetMG Media is veteran-owned (USAF). We understand:
- Mission-focused work
- Building capabilities over time with limited resources
- The value of reliable, maintainable systems
- Serving those who serve their communities

## Growth Path

1. Contractor needs financing qualification → Base model
2. Gets approved, starts booking jobs → Adds gallery
3. Business growing, needs to showcase expertise → Adds blog, testimonials
4. Hiring help, needs professionalism → Service pages, team page
5. Scaling operations → CRM integration, lead management
6. Full operation → Custom software solutions

We grow with them, one upgrade at a time.
