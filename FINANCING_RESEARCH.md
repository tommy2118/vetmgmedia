## Key Insights for VetMG Media Positioning

### 1. **Website/Online Presence Requirements**

**What We Found:**
- Most financing partners DO provide website integration tools (banners, buttons, co-branded landing pages)
- However, **explicit website requirements are NOT heavily documented** in public-facing materials
- The focus is on:
  - Business longevity (2-3 years minimum for Tier 1)
  - Revenue thresholds ($500K-$1M+ for Tier 1)
  - Licensing and insurance
  - BBB reports and financial stability

**What This Means:**
- Having a professional website is **IMPLIED** as part of "legitimate business" criteria
- Financing partners expect contractors to have somewhere to integrate their financing buttons/banners
- Online credibility matters for **customer conversion**, not necessarily for approval as a dealer
- The website is more important for **customer-facing legitimacy** than dealer approval

### 2. **Entry Barriers Vary Widely**

**Tier 1 (GreenSky, Regions, Service Finance, Synchrony, Wells Fargo):**
- High barriers: 2-3 years in business, $500K-$1M+ revenue
- Professional contractors with established operations
- These are the "GreenSky qualification" targets in our messaging

**Tier 2 (Sunlight, PowerPay, Wisetack, Acorn):**
- Lower barriers: Some have no minimum requirements
- Faster approval (24 hours to instant)
- Good for newer contractors or smaller operations

**Tier 3 (Enhancify, FTL, Finturf, etc.):**
- Niche players with specialized requirements or low/no barriers
- Alternative options for contractors who don't qualify for Tier 1

### 3. **Common Themes Across All Partners**

- **Fast funding** (24-48 hours is standard)
- **No or low contractor fees** (competitive pressure)
- **Multiple loan products** to serve various customer credit profiles
- **Mobile apps and software integration** (modern expectation)
- **Marketing support** (banners, training, materials)

## CRITICAL REALIZATION FOR MESSAGING

**Our initial assumption may need refinement:**

We assumed contractors need professional websites to **qualify as dealers** with financing partners. The research shows:

1. **Tier 1 partners** (GreenSky, Regions) have high revenue/longevity requirements - contractors who meet these likely already have some online presence
2. **Tier 2/3 partners** (Wisetack, Acorn, Enhancify) have low/no barriers - contractors can qualify WITHOUT professional websites

**The REAL value proposition is:**

**Contractors need professional websites to:**
1. **Convert customers who want to use the financing** - When a homeowner Googles the contractor before signing a $15K financed HVAC job, they need to see legitimacy
2. **Qualify for PREMIUM financing partners** - GreenSky and Regions won't partner with 6-month-old contractors, but if you have the revenue/history, you still need to look professional
3. **Meet customer expectations** - In 2025, "legitimate business" = professional online presence, regardless of what financing partners explicitly require
4. **Maximize approval rates** - Financing partners check contractor credibility when processing customer applications

**Revised Positioning:**

Instead of: "Get qualified for GreenSky"
Consider: "Look legitimate when customers Google you before signing that $15K financed job"

Or: "You qualified for GreenSky financing. Now make sure your customers feel confident working with you."

Or: "Get the online credibility that matches your business reputation"

---

## Recommended Messaging Adjustments

### Option A: Keep GreenSky Focus, Refine the Angle
"You worked hard to qualify as a GreenSky dealer. Don't lose sales because customers Google you and find nothing - or worse, a DIY website from 2012."

### Option B: Broaden to Customer Trust
"Your customers are financing $10K-$50K projects with you. They're Googling you before signing. Look as legitimate online as you are in person."

### Option C: Dual Pain Point
"Financing partners require online credibility. Customers expect it. Get both without the $8K agency price tag."

### Option D: Simple Business Reality
"In 2025, 'legitimate contractor' means professional website. Start with the base model that gets you credible, upgrade as you grow."

## Action Items for VetMG Media

- [ ] **Decide on primary pain point:** Dealer qualification vs. customer trust vs. both
- [ ] **Determine target tier:** Are we serving Tier 1 qualifiers (established contractors) or Tier 2/3 (newer/smaller operations)?
- [ ] **Refine pricing strategy:** If targeting established contractors (Tier 1), they may have higher budgets - is $1,500 the right entry point?
- [ ] **Test messaging:** Which angle resonates with actual contractors in your network?
- [ ] **Consider partnership opportunities:** Could VetMG Media partner with Tier 2/3 financing companies (Wisetack, Acorn) to offer bundled services?
