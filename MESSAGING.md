# VetMG Media - Marketing Messaging Document
## Option C: Dual Pain Point Strategy

**Core Positioning:** Financing partners require online credibility. Customers expect it. Get both without the $8K agency price tag.

**Target Audience:** Contractors (HVAC, roofing, remodeling, landscaping, etc.) who offer customer financing and need professional online presence to close deals and maintain credibility.

**Primary Pain Points:**
1. Financing partners check contractor legitimacy during customer application process
2. Customers Google contractors before signing high-ticket financed projects ($10K-$50K)
3. Traditional web agencies charge $5K-$15K upfront
4. Contractors can't justify expensive websites when word-of-mouth already works

**Core Solution:** Professional contractor websites built incrementally - start with credibility baseline ($1,500), add features as business grows ($200-300 per upgrade).

## 1. HERO SECTION

### Primary Headline
**"Financing Partners Require Online Credibility. Customers Expect It."**

### Subheadline
**"Get a professional contractor website without the $8K agency price tag. Start with the base model that builds trust and credibility, then upgrade as your business grows."**

### Supporting Copy (Optional - below subheadline)
Whether you work with GreenSky, Synchrony, Service Finance, or other financing partners, your customers are Googling you before they sign. Make sure you look as professional online as you do in person.

### Primary CTA
**"Get Started - $1,500"**

### Secondary CTA
**"See Pricing & Packages"**

### Tertiary CTA (Phone)
**"Talk to a Vet - (502) 240-9897"**

---

## 2. TRUST BAR (Immediately after hero)

Quick credibility hits in single horizontal bar:

**"Veteran-Owned  |  Serving Contractors Since 2021  |  Base Model $1,500  |  Upgrades $200-300"**

Or with icons:

- ✓ **Veteran-Owned & Operated**
- ✓ **3-5 Day Setup**
- ✓ **No Hidden Fees**
- ✓ **Own Your Website**

## 3. THE DUAL PAIN POINT SECTION

### Headline
**"Two Problems. One Solution."**

### Two-Column Layout

**LEFT COLUMN - Problem 1: Customer Trust**

**Icon:** Magnifying glass / Google search

**Headline:** "They're Googling You Before They Sign"

**Body:**
Your customers are financing $10,000 to $50,000 projects with you. Before they commit, they're pulling out their phones and searching your business name.

What do they find?
- Nothing at all?
- A Facebook page from 2019?
- A DIY website that screams "unprofessional"?

You worked hard to earn their trust in person. Don't lose the sale because you look sketchy online.

---

**RIGHT COLUMN - Problem 2: Financing Partner Requirements**

**Icon:** Shield / Checkmark / Documents

**Headline:** "Financing Partners Check Your Credibility"

**Body:**
GreenSky, Synchrony, Regions, Service Finance - they all evaluate contractor legitimacy when processing customer applications.

They're looking for:
- Professional online presence
- Clear contact information
- Services and credentials displayed
- Business legitimacy signals

No professional website = red flags during approval process.

## 12. FAQ SECTION

### Headline
**"Questions Contractors Ask"**

---

**Q: Why do I need a website if I already get plenty of referrals?**

A: You don't need a website for lead generation - your word-of-mouth works great. But when those referrals Google you before signing a $15K financed project, what do they find? A professional website turns "thinking about it" into "let's do this."

---

**Q: What if I'm not approved with GreenSky or other big financing companies yet?**

A: No problem. Having a professional website actually HELPS when you apply to become a financing dealer. It shows you're a legitimate, established business. Plus, your customers expect it regardless of whether you offer financing.

---

**Q: Can't I just use Wix or Squarespace for cheaper?**

A: You could, but:
1. It takes 10-20 hours of your time to build (worth more than $1,500?)
2. Customers and financing partners can spot DIY sites
3. You'll struggle with mobile optimization, SEO, and professional design
4. We know exactly what contractors need - you'll get it right the first time

---

**Q: What if I need to add features later?**

A: That's the whole point. Start with the $1,500 base model, then add $200-300 upgrades whenever you're ready. No timeline. No pressure. You control when and what you upgrade.

---

**Q: Do I own the website or am I renting it?**

A: You OWN it. We build it, hand over all the files, and include 1 year of hosting. After that, you can host it yourself anywhere or continue with us for $120/year. No lock-in. No recurring fees unless you want hosting.

---

**Q: How long does it take to get online?**

A: Base model websites are typically live within 3-5 business days. Upgrades take 3-7 days depending on complexity. Premium/custom projects take 2-6 weeks depending on scope.

---

**Q: What if I need help after launch?**

A: We're not disappearing freelancers. We're veteran-owned and here for the long haul. Email support is free forever. Need updates? We charge $50/hour for minor changes. Need upgrades? We have a menu ready to go.

---

**Q: I'm not very tech-savvy. Will I be able to update the website myself?**

A: The base model is static HTML - super fast and secure, but not DIY-editable. For $300, we can add a simple content management system so you can update text and images yourself. Or just email us changes and we'll handle it for $50/hour.

---

**Q: Do you work with contractors outside Kentucky?**

A: Absolutely. We're based in Kentucky but serve contractors nationwide. Everything is handled remotely - video calls, email, phone. Location doesn't matter.

---

**Q: What information do you need from me to get started?**

A: Not much:
- Business name, logo (if you have one), and brand colors
- Services you offer
- Service area (cities/counties)
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- 5-10 photos of your work (if you have them)
- Any specific content or messaging you want

We handle the rest.

---

**Q: Can you help with my logo and branding too?**

A: We focus on websites, but we have trusted partners for logo design and branding. We can connect you or work with your existing brand materials.

---

**Q: What's your refund policy?**

A: We deliver mockups for approval before finalizing. You get 2 rounds of revisions included. If we can't deliver something you're happy with (rare), we'll refund your deposit. Once the site is live and approved, sales are final.
