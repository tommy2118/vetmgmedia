        <h3>DORA Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Deployment Frequency:</strong>
            <p>Measures how often a team deploys code to production. Higher deployment frequencies typically indicate streamlined processes and shorter development cycles.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lead Time for Changes:</strong>
            <p>Represents the time it takes for a code change to go from commit to deployment in production. Shorter lead times can improve responsiveness and reduce the risk of deployment failures.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Change Failure Rate:</strong>
            <p>Measures the percentage of deployments that result in a failure, requiring a rollback or hotfix. A lower change failure rate indicates a more stable and reliable deployment process.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mean Time to Recovery:</strong>
            <p>Tracks the average time it takes for a team to recover from a failure, such as a production incident or deployment issue. A shorter mean time to recovery signifies a more resilient and adaptive team.</p>
